## Description

This is a dedicated react portfolio to let you know who I am and how to contact me. It is a small snippet into my life and work. You'll see an About Me that lets you know who I am and what I do. You'll also find a Projects section with links to a few of my recent projects. You'll see my contact information with links to my GitHub and my LinkedIn accounts, as well as a form to input your name, email, and send me a personal message. Lastly, you'll have access to a downloadable pdf of my resume.
