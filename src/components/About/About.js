            Hey! I'm Matt.
          </p>
          <p className="fs-5">
            I live in North Carolina. I'm a husband and a dad of two. I have a passion for singing, playing instruments and writing songs. I'm currently a full-stack student at UNC Charlotte learning the art of coding and web development. I've had many great learning experiences throughout my career. Each one teaching me more about myself and how to communicate and care for the people I encounter. Whether that was preparing meals, working a cash register, loading vehicles, processing and ordering inventory, operating heavy machinery, or singing into a microphone live and in recording studios - the collective of experiences has shaped me to have confidence and connectivity in any environment.

            Most recently, I've had the great honor of serving as a Worship Experience Director at Elevation Church. This allowed for a lot of amazing opportunities to grow my talents and share them with others. I was able to adopt a lot of knowledge about the culture of a team and what it takes to keep it healthy. I was able to oversee and manage a team, supporting them in both their personal and professional lives. I was equally challenged and encouraged throughout my time on staff there. I was able to take the things I've learned along the way and cultivate great relational equity as well as produce long-lasting impact and investment.
          </p>
          <p className="fs-5">
            Now I'm on a journey to take what I've learned from those experiences, develop these new skills, explore new opportunities, and see how they all translate for what's ahead for my family.
